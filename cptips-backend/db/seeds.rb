{title: "Try different things as a newbie", author: "@landedstar", content: "Being new is a time to be broad. Try out a hundred different languages, IDEs, frameworks, DBs, OSes, methodologies, etc. Don’t worry about digging deep until you find what sparks joy.", tip_url: "https://twitter.com/landedstar/status/1207397092337102849?s=20"},

{title: "Pseudo Code", author: "@the_real_stacie", content: "Pseudo code and a good plan before any code… No matter what language you're working in pseudo code is a solid first step in solving a prob. If you jump straight to code then you limit yourself to what you know and can get stuck trying to make something work based on syntax you are familiar with.", tip_url: "https://twitter.com/the_real_stacie/status/1207366754164363264?s=20"},

{title: "Read documentation", author: "@PhilBillingsby", content: "Read as much documentation as you can. Plan your code step by step. Pseudocode. Don’t be intimidated by it all. It will make sense at some point!", tip_url: "https://twitter.com/PhilBillingsby/status/1207407594425507844?s=20"},

{title: "Grasp the fundamentals", author: "@richardsession", content: "Try to really grasp the concepts behind what you can do with a programming language and how you can solve problems with it. Most of the popular languages are 85% similar but they just look a little different. If you can grasp the fundamentals then being a polyglot is a lot easier", tip_url: "https://twitter.com/richardsession/status/1207364028970020864?s=20"},

{title: "Comment your code and find a good IDE", author: "@gobias_infosec", content: "Find an IDE you like that analyzes your code, keeps it clean looking and lets you refactor entire libraries at once I mostly program in python and use pycharm since its free. Additionally, comment your code. You will forget what things do even if you wrote them.", tip_url: "https://twitter.com/gobias_infosec/status/1207364292623908865?s=20"},

{title: "How do you learn", author: "@RideWithDaMac", content: "It’s not about what you learn when starting off but HOW you learn. Everybody has their own way of grasping information, you just have to find out which way suits you best. Consistency is also key too, it’s tough but trust me every dev started from zero at one point.", tip_url: "https://twitter.com/RideWithDaMac/status/1207364278317125632?s=20"},
